# ML-learning-with-R
SVM and ANN
I have used exploratory analysis and ML analysis in banking data. The story of the dataset is the customers of a big international bank, who decided to leave (Exited) from the bank. You can find the link here https://www.kaggle.com/code/samikshabhavsar/churn-modelling/data
The language that i used is Greek, i will rewrite and reupload a new file with english.
The best model i found with svm is radial but i've got better results with the ann.
